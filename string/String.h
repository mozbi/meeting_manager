/* 
String class - a subset of the C++ Standard Library <string> class
String objects contain a C-string in a dynamically allocated piece of memory and 
support input/output, comparisons, copy, assignment, and concatenation, and
access to individual characters. 

Individual characters in the string are indexed the same as an array, 0 through length - 1.
The "size" of the string is the length of the internal C-string, as defined by std::strlen
and does not count the null byte marking the end of the C-string. The "allocation" does 
count the null byte. Thus allocation must be >= size + 1.

Many operations result in a string that occupies the minimum amount of memory
(allocation = size + 1), but for efficiency, the operations that involve adding characters
to the string such as += use a doubling rule for allocation to avoid frequent reallocation
of memory and data copying.

The doubling rule: If n characters are to be added to a string, and the current allocation
is  not large enough to hold the result (allocation < size + n + 1), a new piece of memory
is allocated whose size is 2 * (size + n + 1).

The doubling rule is a way to prevent excessive reallocation and copying work as 
the internal contents of a String are expanded - thus it only applies in cases where 
more characters are being added to the String. In particular:

* The concatenation operators += follow the doubling rule.
* Any operator that should be implemented in terms of +=, such as operator+ and operator>>,
will then also follow the doubling rule as a result.
* All other functions and operators either leave the allocation unchanged from the source
(e.g. swap, move assignment) or result in the minimum allocation (size +1).

For those operations that involve indexing into the string such as operator[],
a String_exception is thrown with an error message if the index is not within a valid range.

For testing and demonstration purposes, this class contains static members that record the 
current number of Strings in existence and their total memory allocation. 
If the messages_wanted variable is true, the constructors, destructor, and assignment operators
output a message to demonstrate when these functions are called. The message is output
before the function does the actual work.  To help identify the String involved,
the message includes the relevant string data as follows:
* Constructors - the string data used to initialize this String.
* Destructor - the current string data being held in this String.
* Assignment operators - the string data from the right-hand-side (either a C-string or another String).
Note that only these functions output the messages. Other functions may result
in these messages being output, but only because they call a constructor, destructor, 
or assignment operator as part of their work.
